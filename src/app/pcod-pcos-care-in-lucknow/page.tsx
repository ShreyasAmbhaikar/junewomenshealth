      question: 'What is the actual cost of PCOD and PCOS Care in Lucknow?',
      answer: 'The total cost of PCOD and PCOS care in Lucknow typically ranges between ₹3,000 and ₹8,000 for initial diagnostics, which include complete hormone assays (AMH, LH, FSH, thyroid, prolactin, fasting insulin) and high-resolution pelvic ultrasounds for follicle studies. Ongoing management, including regular follow-up consultations, metabolic checks, and lifestyle/dietary guidance, averages between ₹1,000 and ₹3,000 per month. Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine provides a fully transparent breakdown of diagnostic and medical options during your initial consultation.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the main difference between PCOD and PCOS?',
      answer: 'PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) is a common condition where the ovaries release immature or partially mature eggs due to a temporary hormonal imbalance, often managed effectively through diet and lifestyle shifts. PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) is a more complex endocrine and metabolic disorder involving elevated male hormone levels and insulin resistance, requiring medical treatment and long-term supervision to prevent metabolic complications.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can PCOD or PCOS lead to infertility, and is natural conception possible?',
      answer: 'Yes, both conditions can cause irregular periods and anovulation (lack of egg release), which is a common cause of infertility. However, natural conception is highly achievable. Under Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine\'s guidance, lifestyle modification, weight loss, and low-dose ovulation induction medications successfully restore ovulation, allowing most patients to conceive naturally.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does weight loss help in managing PCOD or PCOS symptoms?',
      answer: 'Losing just 5% to 10% of your body weight is highly therapeutic. It significantly reduces insulin resistance, lowers androgen (male hormone) levels, regulates menstrual cycles, clears up skin issues, and significantly improves natural ovulation and fertility rates.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is it possible to completely cure PCOD or PCOS?',
      answer: 'PCOS is a chronic endocrine condition, meaning there is no permanent cure, but its symptoms can be highly controlled and put into remission. By maintaining healthy lifestyle choices, balanced nutrition, and appropriate medical support, you can live symptom-free and prevent long-term health risks.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What foods should I absolutely avoid if I have PCOD or PCOS?',
      answer: 'It is crucial to avoid processed sugars, refined carbohydrates (like white bread, maida), sweetened beverages, deep-fried snacks, and excess dairy. These foods trigger rapid spikes in blood glucose, which worsens insulin resistance and amplifies hormonal imbalances.'

                  Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD) and Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) are highly prevalent endocrine and metabolic conditions affecting women of reproductive age. Driven by insulin resistance and hormonal imbalances, these conditions lead the ovaries to produce multiple fluid-filled follicles (cysts), which interrupt regular egg development. This can lead to irregular menstrual cycles, pelvic discomfort, unexplained weight gain, skin issues like severe acne, excessive hair growth, and difficulties with natural conception.
