  const faqs = [
    {
      question: 'What is lactational counselling and when should I see a consultant?',
      answer: 'Lactational counselling is clinical guidance provided by a trained medical professional to help new mothers establish and maintain a successful breastfeeding relationship. You should seek counselling if you experience latch difficulties, persistent nipple pain, concerns about low milk supply, or if your baby is not gaining weight adequately.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I know if my baby is latching correctly during breastfeeding?',
      answer: 'A correct latch is pain-free. The baby should take a large portion of the lower areola (not just the nipple) into their mouth, their lips should be flared outward like a fish, their chin should touch your breast, and you should hear soft, rhythmic swallowing sounds rather than clicking noises.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the actual, genuine cost of lactational counselling at the clinic?',
      answer: 'At Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine\'s Women\'s Clinic, transparency is paramount. A 45-minute clinical lactation assessment and hands-on coaching session with Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine is ₹700. Post-procedure checks or follow-up latch reviews are ₹600. Outpatient therapies for engorgement or blocked duct management range from ₹1,000 to ₹2,500 depending on complexity.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What can I do to increase a low breast milk supply naturally?',
      answer: 'Supply is regulated by demand and supply. The most effective way to increase milk is frequent, thorough emptying of the breasts through direct feeding or pumping (every 2-3 hours). Additionally, staying well-hydrated, consuming nutritious meals containing galactagogues (like cumin, fenugreek, and fennel), and resting well can boost supply. Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine can prescribe safe medications if needed.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How can I prevent or treat painful blocked ducts and mastitis?',
      answer: 'To prevent blocked ducts, ensure the breasts are fully emptied at each feed, alternate feeding positions, and avoid tight bras. If you develop a hard, painful lump or fever (signs of mastitis), apply warm compresses, gently massage the area towards the nipple while feeding, nurse frequently, and consult Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine immediately for safe antibiotics.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I walk in with my newborn for breastfeeding support and is the clinic open 24/7?',
      answer: 'Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine\'s Women\'s Clinic operates strictly by prior appointment during dedicated morning and evening timings. We do not support 24/7 walk-in emergency queues. This ensures that new mothers and newborns receive a quiet, private, and highly sterilized lobby space without waiting crowds. Please contact us directly to schedule your session.'
