      question: 'What is the difference between a Pap smear and an HPV DNA test, and do I need both?',
      answer: 'A Pap smear checks for abnormal cellular changes (cytology) on the cervix that could lead to cancer, while an HPV DNA test detects the presence of the actual high-risk Human Papillomavirus strains that cause those changes. For women aged 30 and older, Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine recommends "co-testing" (doing both tests together) for maximum diagnostic accuracy and clinical safety.'
    },
    {
      question: 'At what age should girls or women get the HPV vaccine in Lucknow?',
      answer: 'The HPV vaccine provides the strongest preventive immunity when administered between 9 and 14 years of age (a 2-dose schedule). For girls and women aged 15 to 45 who were not vaccinated earlier, a 3-dose catch-up schedule is highly recommended. Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine evaluates your history to provide honest advice on catch-up vaccinations.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the actual cost of a Pap smear and HPV vaccine at Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine\'s Women\'s Clinic?',
      answer: 'We believe in complete pricing transparency. At our clinic in Sushant Golf City, a Liquid-Based Cytology (LBC) Pap smear test costs between ₹1,500 and ₹2,200, and an HPV DNA co-test is priced between ₹3,000 and ₹4,500. For vaccines, the indigenous DCGI-approved Cervavac (Serum Institute) is ₹2,200 to ₹2,500 per dose, while the international Gardasil 9 (MSD) is ₹10,500 to ₹11,500 per dose.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can sexually active or married women benefit from the HPV vaccine?',
      answer: 'Yes. Although the vaccine is most effective before sexual debut, sexually active and married women still gain significant protection against the high-risk HPV strains they have not yet contracted. It is a vital preventive investment for long-term health.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I still need Pap smear screenings after completing the HPV vaccine schedule?',
      answer: 'Yes, regular cervical screening remains mandatory even after vaccination. While the vaccines protect against the most common cancer-causing strains (such as HPV 16 and 18), they do not cover every single high-risk strain. Regular Pap tests every 3 to 5 years ensure full clinical safety.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I book an appointment, and is the clinic open for emergency walk-ins?',
      answer: 'Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine’s Women’s Clinic is a dedicated, single-doctor clinical practice focusing on personalized, unhurried patient care. We operate strictly by prior appointment during dedicated morning and evening timings, rather than a 24/7 emergency center model. This ensures a sterilized clinical environment and private, confidential screenings. You can schedule a visit by contacting us directly.'

                  Cervical cancer remains a significant health concern for women, yet it is one of the most preventable forms of cancer. It is caused almost exclusively by persistent infections with high-risk strains of the <strong>Human Papillomavirus (HPV)</strong>. By combining routine cervical cancer screenings (such as Pap Smears and molecular HPV DNA testing) with proactive HPV vaccinations, you can establish powerful preventive immunity and reduce your lifetime risk of cervical cancer by over 90%.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At <strong>June Women's Health</strong>, a premier center for gynecological health and preventive medicine in Sushant Golf City and Lucknow, Lucknow, we provide a safe, gentle, and confidential screening environment. Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine provides individualized consultation, guiding women through evidence-based protocols to detect cervical cell abnormalities early and choose the most effective vaccine path.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because we run a focused, single-doctor private clinic rather than a busy corporate hospital, your screenings are conducted personally by Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine. We operate by prior appointments to ensure that every patient receives absolute privacy, meticulous attention, and clinical accuracy in a sterilized clinical environment.
