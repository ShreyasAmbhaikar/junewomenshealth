  const faqs = [
    {
      question: 'What is pubertal counselling and why is it important for adolescent girls?',
      answer: 'Pubertal counselling involves medical, educational, and psychological guidance tailored for girls transitioning through puberty. It helps teenagers understand biological changes, manage hormonal transitions, adopt healthy sanitary habits, and eliminates anxiety or fear surrounding their first period (menarche).'
    },
    {
      question: 'When should a young girl have her first gynaecological consultation?',
      answer: 'Medical guidelines recommend scheduling the first gynecological consult between ages 13 and 15, or earlier if menstrual problems occur. The first visit is strictly conversational and educational—designed to build trust, check developmental growth, and establish comfort with a specialist.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the actual, genuine cost of pubertal counselling at the clinic?',
      answer: 'At Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine\'s Women\'s Clinic, we maintain absolute pricing transparency. A private, 45-minute pubertal counseling and adolescent wellness consultation with Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine is ₹700. If baseline screening laboratory panels (such as thyroid or basic hormone profiles) are required, standard lab costs range from ₹1,500 to ₹3,000.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are irregular periods normal during the first two years after menarche?',
      answer: 'Yes, it is common for menstrual cycles to be irregular for the first 1 to 2 years following menarche because the body\'s hormonal feedback loop (the HPO axis) is still maturing. However, if periods are missed for more than 3 months, occur more frequently than 21 days, or are accompanied by severe pain, an evaluation is recommended.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine manage adolescent PCOS or hormonal acne?',
      answer: 'Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine diagnoses teen PCOS through careful symptom analysis, growth tracking, and simple blood panels. We prioritize gentle, non-medicinal management first, including detailed insulin-sensitizing dietary guides, weight control programs, and targeted pelvic exercise schedules to restore hormonal balance naturally.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I schedule walk-in checkups for my daughter, and is the clinic open 24/7?',
      answer: 'Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine\'s Women\'s Clinic operates strictly by prior appointment during dedicated morning and evening timings. This ensures adolescent patients receive a quiet, stress-free, and private environment without crowded waiting rooms. We are not a 24/7 walk-in clinic. You can contact us directly to book your daughter\'s session.'
