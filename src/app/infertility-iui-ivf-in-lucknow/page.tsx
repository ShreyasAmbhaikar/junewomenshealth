  const faqs = [
    {
      question: 'What is the actual cost of IUI and IVF treatments in Lucknow?',
      answer: 'Fertility treatment costs vary based on individual medical requirements. In Lucknow, a single IUI cycle cost typically ranges from ₹8,500 to ₹25,000, heavily depending on the type of medications required for ovarian stimulation. For IVF, the cost is naturally higher due to advanced embryology lab requirements, generally ranging between ₹1,20,000 and ₹2,00,000 per cycle. At Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine\'s clinic, we provide a completely transparent breakdown of all diagnostic and support costs during your initial consultation so you can plan your finances without surprises.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is the IUI procedure painful, and how long does it take?',
      answer: 'IUI is a simple, outpatient procedure that is virtually painless—most women compare it to the sensation of a routine Pap smear. The actual insemination takes only a few minutes, and you can comfortably resume your normal daily activities almost immediately afterward.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the success rate of IUI treatment?',
      answer: 'The success rate of IUI generally hovers around 10% to 20% per cycle. This rate depends heavily on variables such as the woman\'s age, the quality of the sperm, and the underlying cause of infertility. We typically recommend a trial of 3 to 4 IUI cycles before considering more advanced options like IVF.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does PCOS affect my chances of getting pregnant?',
      answer: 'PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) causes hormonal imbalances that interrupt regular ovulation, making it harder to time conception. However, it is one of the most highly treatable causes of infertility. With customized lifestyle modifications, ovulation induction, and timed intercourse or IUI, the vast majority of women with PCOS successfully conceive.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to visit an IVF center immediately if I can\'t get pregnant naturally?',
      answer: 'Not necessarily. Most couples conceive with simpler, much less expensive interventions like lifestyle optimization, ovulation tracking, or IUI. During your detailed assessment, Dr. Shamim Sultana Yashine will evaluate your specific situation and will only recommend IVF if primary treatments are unsuccessful or if specific conditions (like severe bilateral tubal blockage) exist.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to take complete bed rest after an IUI or IVF embryo transfer?',
      answer: 'No, complete bed rest is a common myth. Strict medical guidelines suggest that routine, light daily activities are perfectly safe and are actually better for promoting healthy pelvic blood circulation. We advise avoiding heavy lifting or strenuous high-impact workouts, but confining yourself to bed does not improve success rates.'

                  Infertility is generally defined as the inability to conceive naturally after 12 months of regular, unprotected intercourse (or after 6 months if you are over 35). <strong>IUI (Intrauterine Insemination)</strong> and <strong>IVF (In-Vitro Fertilization)</strong> are advanced assisted reproductive technologies designed to help couples overcome these challenges. IUI is a minimally invasive procedure that involves placing washed, highly motile sperm directly into the uterus during ovulation. IVF support involves comprehensive pre-cycle preparation, precise hormonal monitoring, and post-embryo transfer medical care to maximize the chances of a successful implantation.
